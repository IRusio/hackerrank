--Solution First
DECLARE @Val int
DECLARE @TopEmployeeEarnings int
SET @Val = (SELECT TOP 1 (months * salary) AS salary FROM Employee ORDER BY salary DESC)
SET @TopEmployeeEarnings = (SELECT COUNT(employee_id) FROM Employee WHERE (months * salary) = @VAL )
SELECT @Val AS "how much", @TopEmployeeEarnings as "result";

--Solution Second
SELECT TOP 1 (salary*months), COUNT(employee_id) FROM employee GROUP BY (salary*months) ORDER BY (salary*months) DESC;
